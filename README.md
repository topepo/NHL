# NHL

A fork of Michael Hainke's [NHL repo](https://github.com/michael-hainke/NHL) where we kick around models to predict whether a shot is on goal or not. 

New code is in the `shots_on_goal` directory. 

Also uses Bill Trans's [ggplot rink code](https://thewincolumn.ca/2021/01/15/r-tutorial-creating-an-nhl-rink-using-the-tidyverse/).
